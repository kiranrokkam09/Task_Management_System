# Task Management System

A simple command-line Task Management System that allows you to manage tasks, view tasks by status or description, update tasks, and delete tasks. This program uses SQLite for the database and offers a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.

## Features:
- Add a new task with a description and deadline.
- View all tasks or filter by status (pending/completed).
- Update task details, including description and status.
- Delete a task by its ID.
- Filter tasks based on the description.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- SQLite (included with Python)

## How to Run the Program:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`Task-Management-System.py`).
4. Run the program by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    python Task-Management-System.py
    ```

    This will start the Task Management System, and you will be prompted with a menu of options.

## Instructions:
Once the program is running, you can choose one of the following options from the menu:

1. **Add a task**: Enter a description and an optional deadline for the task.
2. **View all tasks**: Display all tasks in the system.
3. **View pending tasks**: Filter and view only the tasks marked as "pending".
4. **View completed tasks**: Filter and view only the tasks marked as "completed".
5. **Update a task**: Modify the description and/or status of an existing task.
6. **Delete a task**: Remove a task from the system by its ID.
7. **Filter tasks by description**: Filter tasks based on a part of the description.
8. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Assumptions:
- Task IDs are automatically generated by the database and incremented with each new task.
- Deadlines are optional; you can leave them blank when adding a task.
- Only the statuses `pending` and `completed` are allowed for the `status` field.
- The description field is required when adding or updating tasks.

## Design Decisions:
- The program uses **SQLite** as the database for simplicity and ease of use. It's a lightweight database system that doesn't require setup or a server.
- The system allows filtering by **status** and **description**, enabling the user to search for tasks efficiently.
- Task updates and deletions are done by specifying the **task ID**, which is a unique identifier for each task.
- Error handling is in place for database operations, ensuring that the program handles issues like failed connections or invalid inputs gracefully.

## Database Schema:
The `tasks` table contains the following fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    deadline TEXT,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('pending', 'completed')) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
);
